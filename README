Description --- This is an alteration of the labstatsclient script using AMQP
	    	messaging to send statistics to a server. In order to run this 
		script you need an AMQP Broker running on the local host. The
		script sends a dictionary object of statistics to localhost
		port 5672 (this is the standar AMQP port) and recv.py will
		print out the results in a formatted manner.

labstatsclient.py --- Sends a dictionary object of statistics over AMQP.
		      In order to organize messages each message is sent with
		      a routing key of labstats.hostname 
		      (e.g. labstats.caen-sysstudp04.engin.umich.edu).

recv.py --- Simply prints out all the fields of the message sent followed by 
	    the routing key used. Uses the routing key 
	    labstats.#.engin.umich.edu which will receive any message starting
	    with labstats. and ending with .engin.umich.edu
