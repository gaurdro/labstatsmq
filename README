Description --- This is an alteration of the labstatsclient script using AMQP
	    	messaging to send statistics to a server. In order to run this 
		script you need an AMQP Broker running on the local host. The
		script sends a dictionary object of statistics to localhost
		port 5672 (this is the standar AMQP port) and recv.py will
		print out the results in a formatted manner.

Libraries Needed:
	  python-kombu: AMQP python connection API
	  python-anyjson: used by kombu for json serialization
	  python-amqplib: support for kombu API
