Description --- This is an alteration of the labstatsclient script
	    	using ZeroMQ messaging to send statistics to a server. The
		script sends a dictionary object of statistics to localhost
		port 5555 and recv.py will print out the results in a
	    	formatted manner. 

labstatsclient.py --- Sends a dictionary object of statistics over ZeroMQ.

recv.py --- Simply prints out all the fields of the message sent followed by 
	    the routing key used. Uses the routing key 
	    labstats.#.engin.umich.edu which will receive any message starting
	    with labstats. and ending with .engin.umich.edu

collector.py --- Similar to recv.py, but also uses ZeroMQ's Pub/Sub
                 model to publish the data received from the labstats
                 client to any subscribers.  Publishes on port 5556.

labstats-subscriber.py --- Subscribes to the labstats data.


Libraries Needed:
	  python-zmq: ZeroMQ python connection API
